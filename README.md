# SCCM to Azure Update Manager (AUM) with Azure Arc: Comprehensive Proof of Concept (POC)

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the migration and coexistence of System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) with Azure Update Manager (AUM) in hybrid Windows Server and SQL Server environments. The framework is designed to help organizations assess, plan, and execute a controlled transition from traditional on-premises management to cloud-native solutions.

## Objectives

The primary goals of this Proof of Concept (POC) are to:

- Validate Azure-native server management capabilities through hands-on testing
- Assess feature parity between SCCM and Azure management services across key operational scenarios
- Develop a strategic transition roadmap aligned with business requirements
- Minimize operational disruption during migration through careful planning and testing
- Evaluate cost implications and operational efficiency gains
- Document specific technical requirements and dependencies

## Strategic Overview

### Current Landscape

- **SCCM Status**: Supported and viable for existing infrastructure through at least 2025
- **Azure Direction**: Strategic shift towards cloud-native management services with continuous feature improvements
- **Transition Approach**: Parallel operation and gradual workload migration with risk mitigation
- **Hybrid Considerations**: Support for disconnected and air-gapped environments

### Capability Comparison

| SCCM Capability                       | Azure Equivalent                                | Migration Complexity | Key Considerations |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Patch Management                     | Azure Update Manager                            | Low                 | Native integration with Azure security tools |
| Compliance Management                | Azure Machine Configuration                     | Medium              | Policy-driven approach with enhanced reporting |
| Software Inventory                   | Azure Change Tracking & Inventory               | Medium              | Real-time tracking capabilities |
| Hardware Inventory                   | Azure Resource Graph                            | Low                 | Graph-based querying for fleet insights |
| Application Deployment               | Azure VM Apps, Custom Script Extension          | High                | May require workflow redesign |
| OS Deployment                        | Azure Automation + Scripts                      | High                | Custom automation required |
| Endpoint Protection                  | Microsoft Defender for Cloud                    | Low                 | Enhanced threat protection |

## Key Challenges and Limitations

### Azure Management Service Constraints

- Limited guest application update support requiring supplementary solutions
- No native patch rollback mechanism; requires snapshot-based approach
- Partial sequential patch ring implementation with planned improvements
- Custom scripting required for complex deployment scenarios
- Network considerations for hybrid connectivity
- Compliance reporting differences requiring mapping

## Proof of Concept Environment

### Infrastructure Requirements

- SCCM Lab Environment
  - SQL Express backend for testing
  - Configured WSUS infrastructure
  - Existing patch management collections
  - Test systems representing production workloads

- Azure Prerequisites
  - Azure Arc enabled servers
  - Subscription with appropriate permissions
  - Azure Update Manager configured
  - Network connectivity validation
  - Required RBAC roles assigned

### Onboarding Strategy

```powershell
# Azure Connected Machine Agent Deployment
msiexec /i AzureConnectedMachineAgentSetup.msi /qn ^
  RESOURCE_GROUP="ArcServers" ^
  LOCATION="eastus" ^
  TENANT_ID=<TenantID> ^
  SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<SubID>
```

## Comprehensive Test Scenarios

The test matrix covers 20 critical scenarios across infrastructure, patching, compliance, and operational domains, designed to validate essential functionality and identify potential gaps.

### Test Matrix Overview

| Category         | Focus Areas                                     | Test Cases | Success Criteria |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------|------------------|
| Infrastructure   | Server onboarding, extension compliance        | TC01-TC06  | 100% successful onboarding |
| Patch Management | Update application, maintenance windows        | TC07-TC11  | Zero production impact |
| Database Support | SQL Server patching, availability group safety  | TC04, TC09, TC20 | No AG disruption |
| Operational      | Reporting, RBAC, monitoring integration        | TC10-TC14  | Feature parity with SCCM |
| Advanced Scenarios | Private endpoint, run commands, rollback     | TC15-TC19  | Successful implementation |

## Reporting and Monitoring

### Monitoring Approach

- Azure Monitor Workbooks for comprehensive dashboards
- Log Analytics for detailed query capabilities
- KQL-based telemetry correlation for advanced insights
- Custom reporting templates for stakeholder updates
- Integration with existing monitoring tools

### Sample Monitoring Query

```kql
UpdateSummary
| summarize 
    PatchedMachines = count(distinct Computer),
    MissingCriticalUpdates = sum(CriticalUpdatesMissing),
    LastPatchTime = max(TimeGenerated)
    by UpdateState, Classification
| extend ComplianceStatus = iff(MissingCriticalUpdates == 0, 'Compliant', 'Non-Compliant')
| order by PatchedMachines desc
```

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Validate POC results against organizational requirements and success criteria
2. Develop detailed migration playbook with rollback procedures
3. Create comprehensive training materials for IT operations teams
4. Plan phased rollout with minimal risk and defined success metrics
5. Document lessons learned and best practices
6. Establish ongoing monitoring and optimization processes
