# SCCM to Azure Update Manager (AUM) with Azure Arc – Comprehensive POC Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a structured framework for a Proof of Concept (POC) to evaluate replacing or running **System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM)** alongside **Azure Update Manager (AUM)**, using **Azure Arc** to manage hybrid Windows Server and SQL Server environments.

### Goal

- Test Azure-native server management capabilities.
- Identify feature parity and gaps with SCCM.
- Help IT teams determine transition strategy from SCCM to AUM.

---

## Objectives

- Validate SCCM and AUM coexistence in hybrid environments.
- Confirm end-to-end patching workflows via Azure Arc.
- Identify integration and operational hurdles.
- Provide practical guidance for rollout and testing.

---

## Strategic Considerations

### Lifecycle and Roadmap

- SCCM is **not deprecated** and remains supported.
- **System Center 2022 and 2025** are actively supported.
- Azure-native tools like **AUM, Arc, and Machine Configuration** represent the strategic direction.

### Transition Philosophy

- Do **not** decommission SCCM abruptly.
- Begin with **side-by-side** deployments.
- Transition to AUM for supported workloads progressively.

## SCCM vs Azure Management Services – Capability Comparison

| **SCCM Capability**                    | **Azure Native Alternative**                           |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Patch Management                       | Azure Update Manager                                   |
| Compliance & Configuration Management | Azure Machine Configuration                            |
| Software Inventory                     | Azure Change Tracking & Inventory                      |
| Hardware Inventory                     | Azure Resource Graph                                   |
| Application Deployment                 | Azure VM Apps, Custom Script Extension                 |
| OS Deployment / Upgrade               | Azure Automation + Custom Scripts                     |
| Troubleshooting                        | Azure Automation, Run Command                          |
| Audit and Compliance                   | Azure Change Tracking, Change Analysis                 |
| Endpoint Protection                    | Microsoft Defender for Cloud                           |

## Key Feature Gaps in Azure (vs SCCM)

- **Guest App Updates** – No native support for 3rd-party apps like Chrome. Use Winget or Shared Gallery as workaround.
- **In-place OS Upgrades** – Not automated; requires scripting/runbooks.
- **Patch Rollback** – No native rollback; plan via snapshots or restore points.
- **Patch Rings** – Basic tagging support; enhancements planned.
- **Distribution Points** – No direct WSUS alternative; Guest Patching Service is upcoming.

---

## POC Environment Setup

### 1. SCCM Lab Deployment

- Install SCCM using SQL Express.
- Enable and configure WSUS.
- Define collections for patching.

### 2. Azure Arc Onboarding (via GPO or Script)

```powershell
msiexec /i AzureConnectedMachineAgentSetup.msi /qn ^
  RESOURCE_GROUP="ArcServers" ^
  LOCATION="eastus" ^
  TENANT_ID=<TenantID> ^
  SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<SubID>
