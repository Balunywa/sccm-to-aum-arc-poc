# SCCM to Azure Update Manager (AUM) with Azure Arc – Comprehensive POC Documentation

## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive framework for a Proof of Concept (POC) to evaluate the replacement or side-by-side operation of System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) with Azure Update Manager (AUM), using Azure Arc to manage hybrid Windows Server and SQL Server environments.

## Goal

- Provide a structured way to test Azure-native server management.
- Identify gaps and validate feature parity with SCCM.
- Help IT teams decide when and how to transition from SCCM to AUM.

## Objectives

- Evaluate SCCM and AUM coexistence in hybrid environments.
- Validate end-to-end patching workflows for Windows Server and SQL Server through Azure Arc.
- Identify integration and operational challenges.
- Provide hands-on guidance for testing and rollout planning.

## Strategic Considerations

### Lifecycle and Roadmap of SCCM

- SCCM is not deprecated and should continue to be used where it meets current needs.
- System Center 2022 and 2025 will remain supported.
- Azure-native services including AUM, Arc, and Machine Configuration are the strategic direction.

### Transition Philosophy

- Do not remove SCCM immediately.
- Run SCCM and AUM in parallel.
- Gradually shift supported workloads to AUM.

## SCCM vs Azure Management Services Capability Map

| SCCM Capability                        | Azure Equivalent                                |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Patch Management                      | Azure Update Manager                            |
| Compliance / Configuration Management | Azure Machine Configuration                     |
| Asset Inventory (Software)            | Azure Change Tracking & Inventory               |
| Asset Inventory (Hardware)            | Azure Resource Graph                            |
| Application Deployment                | Azure VM Apps, Custom Script Extension          |
| OS Deployment / Upgrade               | Azure Automation + Scripts                      |
| Troubleshooting                       | Azure Automation, Run Command                   |
| Audit and Compliance                  | Azure Change Tracking, Change Analysis          |
| Endpoint Protection                   | Microsoft Defender for Cloud                    |

## Key Feature Gaps in Azure Management (vs SCCM)

- Guest Application Updates – Not currently supported in AUM (e.g., Chrome, Acrobat).
- Automated In-place OS Upgrades – Requires custom runbooks and pre-check scripts.
- Patch Rollback – No native rollback support.
- Sequential Patch Rings – Basic support available; full ring control improvements are coming.
- Distribution Points – No WSUS replacement; Azure Guest Patching enhancements are planned.

## POC Environment Setup

### 1. SCCM Deployment

- Install SCCM in a lab using SQL Express.
- Enable WSUS and configure patching collections.

### 2. Azure Arc Onboarding (via GPO or Script)
