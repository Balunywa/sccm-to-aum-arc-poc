# SCCM to Azure Update Manager (AUM) with Azure Arc: Comprehensive Proof of Concept (POC)

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the migration and coexistence of System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) with Azure Update Manager (AUM) in hybrid Windows Server and SQL Server environments. The framework is designed to help organizations assess, plan, and execute a controlled transition from traditional on-premises management to cloud-native solutions.

## Objectives

The primary goals of this Proof of Concept (POC) are to:

- Validate Azure-native server management capabilities through hands-on testing
- Assess feature parity between SCCM and Azure management services across key operational scenarios
- Develop a strategic transition roadmap aligned with business requirements
- Minimize operational disruption during migration through careful planning and testing
- Evaluate cost implications and operational efficiency gains
- Document specific technical requirements and dependencies

## Strategic Overview

### Current Landscape

- **SCCM Status**: Supported and viable for existing infrastructure through at least 2025
- **Azure Direction**: Strategic shift towards cloud-native management services with continuous feature improvements
- **Transition Approach**: Parallel operation and gradual workload migration with risk mitigation
- **Hybrid Considerations**: Support for disconnected and air-gapped environments

### Sample Monitoring Query

```kql
UpdateSummary
| summarize 
    PatchedMachines = count(distinct Computer),
    MissingCriticalUpdates = sum(CriticalUpdatesMissing),
    LastPatchTime = max(TimeGenerated)
    by UpdateState, Classification
| extend ComplianceStatus = iff(MissingCriticalUpdates == 0, 'Compliant', 'Non-Compliant')
| order by PatchedMachines desc
```
