# SCCM to Azure Update Manager (AUM) with Azure Arc: Comprehensive Proof of Concept (POC)

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the migration and coexistence of System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) with Azure Update Manager (AUM) in hybrid Windows Server and SQL Server environments.

## Objectives

The primary goals of this Proof of Concept (POC) are to:

- Validate Azure-native server management capabilities
- Assess feature parity between SCCM and Azure management services
- Develop a strategic transition roadmap
- Minimize operational disruption during migration

## Strategic Overview

### Current Landscape

- **SCCM Status**: Supported and viable for existing infrastructure
- **Azure Direction**: Shift towards cloud-native management services
- **Transition Approach**: Parallel operation and gradual workload migration

### Capability Comparison

| SCCM Capability                       | Azure Equivalent                                | Migration Complexity |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Patch Management                     | Azure Update Manager                            | Low                  |
| Compliance Management                | Azure Machine Configuration                     | Medium               |
| Software Inventory                   | Azure Change Tracking & Inventory               | Medium               |
| Hardware Inventory                   | Azure Resource Graph                            | Low                  |
| Application Deployment               | Azure VM Apps, Custom Script Extension          | High                 |
| OS Deployment                        | Azure Automation + Scripts                      | High                 |
| Endpoint Protection                  | Microsoft Defender for Cloud                    | Low                  |

## Key Challenges and Limitations

### Azure Management Service Constraints

- Limited guest application update support
- No native patch rollback mechanism
- Partial sequential patch ring implementation
- Custom scripting required for complex deployment scenarios

## Proof of Concept Environment

### Infrastructure Requirements

- SCCM Lab Environment
  - SQL Express backend
  - Configured WSUS
  - Existing patch management collections

- Azure Prerequisites
  - Azure Arc enabled
  - Subscription with appropriate permissions
  - Azure Update Manager configured

### Onboarding Strategy

```powershell
# Azure Connected Machine Agent Deployment
msiexec /i AzureConnectedMachineAgentSetup.msi /qn ^
  RESOURCE_GROUP="ArcServers" ^
  LOCATION="eastus" ^
  TENANT_ID=<TenantID> ^
  SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<SubID>
```

## Comprehensive Test Scenarios

The test matrix covers 20 critical scenarios across infrastructure, patching, compliance, and operational domains.

### Test Matrix Overview

| Category         | Focus Areas                                     | Test Cases |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Infrastructure   | Server onboarding, extension compliance        | TC01-TC06  |
| Patch Management | Update application, maintenance windows        | TC07-TC11  |
| Database Support | SQL Server patching, availability group safety  | TC04, TC09, TC20 |
| Operational      | Reporting, RBAC, monitoring integration        | TC10-TC14  |
| Advanced Scenarios | Private endpoint, run commands, rollback     | TC15-TC19  |

## Reporting and Monitoring

### Monitoring Approach

- Azure Monitor Workbooks
- Log Analytics
- KQL-based telemetry correlation

### Sample Monitoring Query

```kql
UpdateSummary
| summarize 
    PatchedMachines = count(distinct Computer),
    MissingCriticalUpdates = sum(CriticalUpdatesMissing)
    by UpdateState, Classification
| order by PatchedMachines desc
```

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Validate POC results against organizational requirements
2. Develop detailed migration playbook
3. Create training materials for IT operations
4. Plan phased rollout with minimal risk
