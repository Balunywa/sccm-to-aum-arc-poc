# SCCM to Azure Update Manager (AUM) with Azure Arc – Comprehensive POC Documentation

## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive framework for a Proof of Concept (POC) to evaluate the replacement or side-by-side operation of **System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM)** with **Azure Update Manager (AUM)**, using **Azure Arc** to manage hybrid Windows Server and SQL Server environments.

### Goal

- Provide a structured way to test Azure-native server management
- Identify gaps and validate feature parity with SCCM
- Help IT teams decide when and how to transition from SCCM to AUM

---

## Objectives

- Evaluate SCCM and AUM coexistence in hybrid environments
- Validate end-to-end patching workflows for Windows Server and SQL Server through Azure Arc
- Identify integration and operational challenges
- Provide hands-on guidance for testing and rollout planning

---

## Strategic Considerations

### Lifecycle and Roadmap of SCCM
- SCCM is **not deprecated**, **and you should continue using it if it meets your requirements**.
- **System Center 2022 and 2025** will continue to receive support.
- Azure-native tools (AUM, Arc, Machine Configuration) are the **recommended future path**.

### Transition Philosophy
- **Do not remove SCCM immediately**.
- Start with **side-by-side evaluation**.
- Gradually transition to AUM for supported use cases.

## SCCM vs Azure Management Services Capability Map

| SCCM Capability                       | Azure Equivalent                                |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Patch Management                     | Azure Update Manager                            |
| Compliance / Configuration Management| Azure Machine Configuration                     |
| Asset Inventory (Software)           | Azure Change Tracking & Inventory               |
| Asset Inventory (Hardware)           | Azure Resource Graph                            |
| Application Deployment               | Azure VM Apps, Custom Script Extension          |
| OS Deployment / Upgrade              | Azure Automation + Scripts                      |
| Troubleshooting                      | Azure Automation, Run Command                   |
| Audit and Compliance                 | Azure Change Tracking, Change Analysis          |

##  Key Feature Gaps in Azure Management (vs SCCM)

- **Guest Application Updates** – Not currently supported in AUM (e.g., Chrome, Acrobat). Proposed: Winget or Shared Gallery.
- **Automated In-place OS Upgrades** – Requires custom runbooks and pre-check scripts.
- **Patch Rollback** – No native rollback. Risk management needed.
- **Sequential Patch Rings** – Basic support; enhancements coming.
- **Distribution Points** – No direct replacement for WSUS. Azure Guest Patching Service planned.

---

##  POC Environment Setup

### 1. SCCM Deployment
- Deploy SCCM using SQL Express in lab environment
- Enable WSUS
- Create patching collections

### 2. Azure Arc Onboarding (via GPO or Script)

```powershell
msiexec /i AzureConnectedMachineAgentSetup.msi /qn ^
  RESOURCE_GROUP="ArcServers" ^
  LOCATION="eastus" ^
  TENANT_ID=<TenantID> ^
  SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<SubID>

###  Azure Update Manager Configuration

3. **Enable Azure Update Manager**

- Assign update schedules via Azure Portal or automation
- Define **patch rings** using Azure Tags or dynamic scoping
- Enable **SQL AG-aware patching** (Preview Feature)
- Validate server visibility and compliance configuration in **Azure Arc**

##  Extended Scope Testing

- Validate **update orchestration across multiple regions**
- Evaluate **Private Endpoint configuration** for AUM
- Integrate **SQL Best Practices Analyzer (BPA)** using Azure Arc
- Enable **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** integration
- Simulate **rollback procedures** using snapshot restore or manual fallback

---

## Reporting & Monitoring

- Build real-time dashboards using **Azure Monitor Workbooks**
- Compare and monitor update states across tools using:
  - Patch compliance level
  - Last scan time
  - Patch classification trends (e.g., Critical, Security)
- Use **Log Analytics KQL queries** to extract update, agent, and compliance insights across Arc-enabled machines

Example KQL:
```kql
UpdateSummary
| summarize count() by Computer, Classification, UpdateState
